[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions for [2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025/), done in (beginner) Rust.

If it's anything like when I did AoC [in Go in 2022](https://github.com/WJBarnes456/aoc-2022) I'm expecting to develop a lot over the course of the ~~month~~ next 12 days!

If any Rustacean chances on this repo please feel free to give me tips via email to my commit address, they'd be much appreciated.
